# Arducoman DefTechHackathon

Hello. now I want to present to you our project "EAGLE 2".
- The peculiarities of our drone are that it is modular and multifunctional. Also, due to our original approach to accumulation, it is able to hang in the air longer than its competitors. Part of the case is made of a special polymer that allows it to be used as a solar panel. We also return some energy from the drone's motors through the method of reverse induction (like in Tesla cars).
-The drone consists of a main base and a module docking to it.
at the moment we have developed 2 types of modules (for civilians, like a patrol drone. and for the military, for finding mines, creating a mine map and deactivating them.)
-the drone is capable of working in all weather conditions.
the drone uses an encrypted communication channel protocol (AES 256)
-1) how it will work for civilians. A patrol drone, due to our software, will automatically fly around the city and scan people's faces (by connecting to the servers of internal services, it will determine the identities of passers-by) when a person is wanted or an unusual sight, the drone will notify the authorities and the nearest patrol cars.
the patrolman is also capable of providing first aid. it is equipped with a speaker and microphone.
(Imagine this situation. A person on the street has a heart attack. The nearest passer-by calls an ambulance and waits, meanwhile the ambulance service calls the nearest drone for the patient. As he moves around the city, he flies faster. The medical worker gains access to the drone and already sees the situation through the camper and can speak through the speakers to passers-by how to provide assistance before the ambulance arrives (the drone is equipped with a special first aid kit))
-2) how it will work for the military.
using the module for the military, it will perform the following work (Finding a mine, creating a map of minefields, deactivating a min signal repeater and encrypting it to alert civilians and military personnel in a combat zone)
